- ## Mission
    - Smllab is a machine learning lab which goal it is to specifically accelerate progress in science and engineering related fields. 
    - For that we build a community around this science topics and setup diverse projects to work on. We are an open community and everyone can join for contribution.

- ## Projects 
    - ### [MLhouse](https://www.intelligencehouse.org/)
        - **What**
            - A community house where people of the community live an. 
        - **Why**
            - Serendipity. What was the magic in Los Alamos?
        - **How**
            - At least 5 people need to come together for that. Contact @MaxHager in Discord if you are interested.

    - ### Hackerspace
        - **What**
            - A working space with optimal conditions for solving complex machine learning problems (whiteboards, energy drinks) 
        - **Why**
            - Serendipity and positive competition.
        - **How**
            - At least 5 people need to come together and than renting out a space somewhere. This project could be eventually fusion with the MLhouse. Contact @MaxHager in Discord if you are interested.
    - ### Hackathons 
        - **What**
            - Regularly happening hackathons for machine learning projects, community related projects.
        - **Why**
            - Progress and connection.
        - **How** 
            - Asking a university for an hacking space (as long we do not have our own) and than choosing one of the projects we are working on for it. Contact @MaxHager in Discord if you are interested.
